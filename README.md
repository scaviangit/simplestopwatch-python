# simplestopwatch-python
A basic and simple CLI based stopwatch written in python that performs what a stopwatch does, counting time and stuff.
Only made of learning purposes and ideal for actual use, i might jump off a cliff just trying to run a python script everytime just to have a stopwatch counting time.
